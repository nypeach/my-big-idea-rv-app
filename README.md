# 🚐 Big Vision: The Ultimate Travel Companion for RVers

## Overview
This platform will be a comprehensive travel assistant for RV enthusiasts. It will consist of:
- A **Web Application** (React-based)
- A **Mobile App** (built with React Native for both iPhone and Android)

All versions will be synchronized, user-friendly, and built with a map-centric interface powered by **Google Maps**.

---

## 🧭 Core Objectives
- Enable safe, efficient, and enjoyable RV travel.
- Provide hyper-relevant routing and location data for oversized vehicles.
- Support multi-vehicle caravanning and coordination (e.g., RV and EV).
- Leverage APIs to deliver real-time alerts, safe routes, and useful data for planning.

---

## 🗺️ Map & Navigation Features
- ✅ **Google Maps integration** with overlays for RV-specific data.
- 🚧 **Construction and Detour Aware Routing** that filters out roads unsuitable for RVs.
- ⛔ **Bridge/Tunnel Clearance Warnings** (based on vehicle specs).
- 🛑 **Hazmat Tunnel Restrictions** (real-time flagging for compliance).
- 🪧 **Low Clearance and Weight Limit Alerts** for bridges and roads.
- 🗺️ **Route planning that avoids sharp turns or difficult maneuvers**.

---

## 🛢️ RV + EV Refueling Coordination
- 🔍 **Search for locations** that have:
  - Diesel stations with large open fueling areas.
  - Tesla Superchargers.
  - Easy ingress/egress for large rigs.
- 🔄 **Multi-stop planning** to match diesel fill-up with EV charging needs.

---

## 📋 Vehicle Intelligence
- 🚐 **Enter VINs for RV and Tow Vehicle**
  - Automatically pull specs like:
    - Height
    - Length
    - Weight
    - Axle configuration
    - Tow ratings
- 🧠 VIN-based smart routing that factors in:
  - Legal limits
  - Road restrictions
  - Turn radius considerations

---

## 👨‍👩‍👦 Caravan Support
- 📍 **Live location sharing** with other users (e.g., family members).
- 🔔 **ETA sync and fuel/charge coordination**.
- 🗨️ Caravan chat or check-in notifications.

- [ ] VIN decoding services (e.g., NHTSA or commercial APIs)

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack (To Be Expanded)
- Web Frontend: React
- Mobile App: React Native (cross-platform iOS + Android)
- Backend: Node.js with Express (or alternative)
- Maps: Google Maps SDK + RV overlay layers
- Auth: OAuth2 or Firebase
- VIN Decoder: TBD (API-dependent)

---

## 🚧 Roadmap Draft (WIP)
1. Define MVP feature set.
2. Build VIN decoding and basic RV routing.
3. Integrate Google Maps with clearance data.
4. Add diesel & EV charger search overlay.
5. Pilot with real caravan group.
6. Launch beta.

## 🧠 Notes
- The goal is to make this app the *Waze for RVs*.
- Prioritize *real-world usability* over completeness.
- Focus on pain points that currently require multiple apps and manual searching.
